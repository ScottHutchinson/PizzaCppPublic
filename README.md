# PizzaCppPublic

To complete this solution, clone this repo, and add native C++ code to the \pizzaCPP\pizzaCPP.cpp file to list the 20 most popular pizzas. The main function in that file already contains a populated std::vector of pizzas that was parsed from a downloaded JSON file using the Newtonsoft.Json open source .NET libary via the JsonLibrary C++/CLI project.

Submit your completed pizzaCPP.cpp file as a secret GitHub gist (https://gist.github.com). Then, add a GitHub comment with your output.
